#NJIT CS490 Final Project

Final Project for my senior Software Development and Design class at NJIT>

The project goal was to create a Introductory Computer Science test taking website.
There would be a student and teacher log in. 

Teacher Role:
  - Create questions in the form of "Write a function that...." and provide test cases
  - Create exams for the students to take

Student Role:
  - Take test and answer to the best of their ability

My Role:
  - Once the student finished their exam, there answers were automatically graded by running their code and comparing their output to the test case output. Certain easy errors we're also looked for (forgeting a colon). It was the programmers job to automate determining if the student made any simple mistakes, fix them before running the autograding and then deduct points after the autograding is complete.

I was responsible for the Middle (Autograding) and Backend of this project. My partner was responsible for the Frontend.
